       <h4>User Story</h4> 
       <p> Rick loves an app called DoStuff. Every time he thinks of something fun to do, he adds the idea to his list. Then, when he’s bored, he looks through his list and picks something that looks fun.
        DoStuff has a “check-in” feature that lets Rick track how many times he has done each idea.  So, for example, he added “Play ping pong” to DoStuff 3 years ago, and since then he has played ping pong 64 times.
        When Rick looks for something to do, weather is a big factor. If it’s super hot, he’ll either want to be in water or air conditioning. If it’s raining, he really enjoys cozy coffee shop and bookstore environments. He loves exploring the outdoors when it’s pleasant out.
        Another factor he thinks about is whether he would have to invite friends or not. For example, he’ll go for a jog alone, but he won’t go to a bar alone. If all his friends are busy, he has to look for solo activities.
        Finally, Rick is often attracted to ideas that prompt good memories. For example, last time he browsed through activity ideas, he saw a photo of himself sunning in the lawn of Barton Springs Pool. “Oh man, that was such a relaxing day. I can’t believe it’s been over a year since I’ve visited Barton Springs. I should do that next.”

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
       <p> Rick has entered so many ideas into DoStuff, it’s getting a bit crowded. There are some ideas he added years ago, but never did. After all this time, he really doubts he’ll pick one of them.
        Rick wants to delete all the ideas that are more than two years old, have zero check-ins</p>
       <p> Design an object management page, and show how Rick uses it to perform this task.</p>
